---

## Performance Metrics

### Training Set
- Accuracy: 0.7832

### Test Set
- Accuracy: 0.7727

---

## Observations
- The model performs consistently on both training and test data, indicating low variance and minimal overfitting.
- Linear SVM is a good baseline due to its interpretability and speed.

---

## Next Steps
- Compare performance with other algorithms (Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression)
- Evaluate with additional metrics:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC Curve
- Perform feature importance or SHAP analysis
- Handle potential data imbalances (e.g. SMOTE)
